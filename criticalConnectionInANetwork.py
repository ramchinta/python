'''There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network
where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b.
Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.



Example 1:



Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
There are no repeated connections.'''
